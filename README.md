## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS variables

### What I learned

- That project made me learn about semantic HTML5

- Working with flexible display using the flexbox properties, positioning elements on the screen.

- Working with two-dimensional grid system display using the Grid properties, positioning elements on the screen.

- Working with external fonts (Google fonts) to improve a better custom apparence.

- Working with separated documents, improving organization and responsability to every document with its function in the whole project.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="src/styles/reset.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="src/styles/variables.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="src/styles/style.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="src/styles/responsive.css" />
```

- Working with variables reducing the code and establishing a pattern easiest to manage.

```CSS
:root {
  --cyan: hsl(179, 62%, 43%);
  --bright-yellow: hsl(71, 73%, 54%);

  --light-gray: hsl(204, 43%, 93%);
  --grayish-blue: hsl(218, 22%, 67%);

  --shadow-button: hsl(179, 73%, 38%);
  --why-us: hsl(179, 64%, 52%);

  --font-family: "Karla", sans-serif;
}
```
